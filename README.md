To run the program, first check out run_analysis.R file, and make sure you have a data folder. Then just run run_analysis.R in R studio or R console.

run_analysis.R will read the ZIP file from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip, unzip it, read all the files, replace headers, and activities names, then gather data and create tidy data.
